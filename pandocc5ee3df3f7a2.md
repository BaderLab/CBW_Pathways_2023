**Tip 1**: further editing and formatting can be performed on the AutoAnnote results using the *AutoAnnotate Display* in the *Results Panels* located at the right side of the window.<br> For example, it is possible to change Ellipse to Rectangle, uncheck *Scale font by cluster size* and increase the *Font Scale* using the scaling bar. It is also possible to reduce the length of the cluster label by checking the "Word Wrap" option.

**Tip 2**: The AutoAnnotate window on the left side in Result Panel contains the list of all clusters. Clicking on a cluster label will highlight in yellow all nodes in this cluster. It is then easy to move the nodes using the mouse to avoid cluster overlaps.
