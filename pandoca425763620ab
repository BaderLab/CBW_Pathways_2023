<p>Make sure that you have mapped a volume on your computer to a volume
in your container so that files you create are also saved on your
computer. That way, turning off or deleting your container or image will
not effect your files.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The parameter <strong>-v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects</strong> maps
your current directory (i.e.Â the directory you are in when launching the
container) to the directory /home/rstudio/projects on your
container.</li>
<li>You do not need to use the ${PWD} convention. You can also specify
the exact path of the directory you want to map to your container.</li>
<li>Make sure to save all your scripts and notebooks in the projects
directory.</li>
</ul>
