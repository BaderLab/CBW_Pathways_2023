Make sure that you have mapped a volume on your computer to a volume in your container so that files you create are also saved on your computer.  That way, turning off or deleting your container or image will not effect your files.<br>

* The parameter **-v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects** maps your current directory (i.e. the directory you are in when launching the container) to the directory /home/rstudio/projects on your container.
* You do not need to use the ${PWD} convention.  You can also specify the exact path of the directory you want to map to your container. 
* Make sure to save all your scripts and notebooks in the projects directory.
